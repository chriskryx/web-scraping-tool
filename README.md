# web-scraping-tool
 I have made this script in Python using BeautifulSoup. You will need BeautifulSoup and urllib modules installed. I have used it to find different businesses that might need an updated website.  Run "web_scraping.py" from CMD inside a folder. After giving the 4 inputs, the script will create an Excel (.csv) file inside that folder , containing 3 columns: "Business name", "Website" and "Location".  The script was made specifically for https://www.romanian-companies.eu/ so it will not work for other websites.
